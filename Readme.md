# Reporting for WinForms - Export Options and After Export Actions

This example shows how to specify export options for various export formats, and how to modify export commands to perform additional actions.

- The [DevExpress.XtraPrinting.ExportOptions](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.ExportOptions) stores the document export options for different export formats. 
- The [DevExpress.PrintingSystemBase.AddCommandHandler](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.PrintingSystemBase.AddCommandHandler(DevExpress.XtraPrinting.ICommandHandler)) method allows you to add a custom command.
- The **DevExpress.XtraPrinting.VisualExportTool** class contains methods that work in the same manner as the export commands.
